If you are so inclined, there are several ways to give back to the mGBA project, including both monetary and non-monetary ways.

Please keep in mind that none of these are required for keeping mGBA free and open, but do help keep the project alive and are very welcome. Thank you for using mGBA!

## Patreon

mGBA hosts a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/mgba) that you can use to pledge a monthly donation. Any amount is welcome, even as low as $1 per month.

We would like to thank the following patrons from Patreon:

{% for patron in site.data.patrons %}

{% endfor %}

## More hardware

There are several games and accessories for the GBA that are either not emulated properly or would be emulated better with additional research. More information is available [on the forums](https://forums.mgba.io/showthread.php?tid=466).

## Code

More coders are always welcome! Take a look at the [GitHub page](https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba) for more information.
