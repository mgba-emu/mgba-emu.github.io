Bugs are being tracked on the [GitHub Issues](https://mgba.io/i/) associated with the main repository. There is also an older [Bugzilla instance](https://endrift.com/mgba/bugs/), but filing bugs there is not recommended.

Reporting
---------
To file a bug without an account, please send an email with the name of the game and a detailed description of the bug to [mgba-bugs@endrift.com](mailto:mgba-bugs@endrift.com). Bugs submitted here will be entered manually into GitHub Issues after being moderated.
